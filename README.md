# CS230---OperatingPlatforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room enlisted help in software design for the web-based Draw It or Lose It game application for the company “The Gaming Room”. The game is based on the concept of the popular 1980s television game "Win, Lose or Draw," where teams compete to guess a puzzle based on rendered images. The application allows multiple teams with multiple players to participate in four rounds of play. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I did well in clearly differentiating the various operating systems and describing the variances in development

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The UML documentation aided the most in setting up expectations on how the program was intended to work, even if the details for how the program is intended to work were more ambiguous.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I was happy with the document. The only revision I would make is work on stylization and formatting each section, improving readability.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Using Design Restraints and Requirements from the documentation, a developer has a better understanding of what is wanted from stakeholders and users. A developer should create a streamlined, user friendly experience. To create a design the developer would like to use themselves.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approach design and development based on what the stakeholder wants and leverage what the users would want in their experience. I need to gain better understanding of UML design and similar documentation to better analyze the different parts and pieces of how the software is intended to work.
